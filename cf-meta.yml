  # CF: A succinct description of what is in the dataset.
  title: "DCS4COP Sentinel-3 OLCI L2C Data Cube"

  # CF: The method of production of the original data.
  # If it was model-generated, source should name the model and its version, as specifically as could be useful.
  # If it is observational, source should characterize it (e.g., "surface observation" or "radiosonde").
  source: "Sentinel-3 OLCI L2 surface observation"



  # Describe the restrictions to data access and distribution.
  license: "terms and conditions of the DCS4COP data distribution"

  # CF: Provides an audit trail for modifications to the original data.
  # Well-behaved generic netCDF filters will automatically append their name and the
  # parameters with which they were invoked to the global history attribute of an input netCDF file.
  # We recommend that each line begin with a timestamp indicating the date and time of day
  # that the program was executed.

  # CF: Specifies where the original data was produced.
